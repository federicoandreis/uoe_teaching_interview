# Teaching Interview - University of Edinburgh
This repository contains the materials requested for my teaching interview at the University of Edinburgh, 8th March 2021. The date on the slides is that of the 5th March 2021, which is the day of submission (as well as the 194th anniversary of Pierre-Simon Laplace's death, it seemed a nice coincidence!)

## Direct links
The learning material for this lecture comprises:

- slides (PDF | RMD)
- video (MP4 | ...)
- transcript (TXT).

## Accessibility
A full transcript for the recording is available. I generated closed captions while recording, but unfortunately something did not quite work and they were not of good enough quality to be included. I then resolved to upload the video on YouTube so that the automatic cc generation feature could be exploited (not optimal, but...).

[Colour vision deficiency](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/colour-vision-deficiency/) (CVD) is a relatively prevalent condition (the NHS estimates in ~4.5% the proportion of British population affected by some form of it). While a second-year class at a Scottish university is likely be more diverse than the general population, we cannot rule out that some students might have congenital difficulties in distinguishing colours.

Therefore, I have picked the colour palette for these slides according to accessibilty criteria. Specifically, only four colours were used, which were selected to meet the [WebAIM contrast checker criteria](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and such that they were clearly distinguishable in the presence of the least rare types of CVD (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia). I tested for the latter using a [simulation tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23800020-%23F8F8FF-%23080808-%23F8F8FF-%230000D6) that would allow me to compare colours across conditions and side by side. Moreover, I have used the "structurebold" font-theme from RMarkdown: the text typeface is clean and straight, the font is sans-serif, and I left the sizes at their the default.
